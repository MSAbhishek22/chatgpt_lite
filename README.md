### 🛠️ Project Overview

Say hello to my mini version of **ChatGPT** — a simple yet powerful chatbot that can perform a variety of tasks using Google’s free AI API!

This project was built using:

- 🧠 **Google AI Studio** – for generating API keys and leveraging AI
- ⚙️ **Assistant UI** – a clean and intuitive frontend
- 🔗 **GitHub** – for version control and code management
- ☁️ **Vercel** – to deploy the chatbot and make it publicly accessible

It’s a great hands-on way to explore how APIs work, understand backend integrations, and get a feel for deploying real-world AI apps — all in one go! 🚀
